##About Taramouse

>I am currently experimenting with and learning about all the new stuff for C# in Visual Studio 2015 on Windows 10.

Activities include:
+ ASP.NET MVC5 Web Apps
+ .NETcore and DNVM, DNX 1.0.0-beta6 (For UWP with EF7) or beta7 (MVC5), DNU
+ Entity Framework 7
+ SQL Server and SQLite Databases
+ Universal Windows Projects
+ Much head scratching

>I'm planning on putting empty VS2015 project templates in my repo which work out of the box with the beta6 and beta7 DNX, unlike currently supplied versions.
